MySchool is a portfolio-building app for parents and students participating in homeschooling activities. We make it quick and easy to add schoolwork examples or activity information to a printable PDF. Based on the Maryland state requirements for homeschoolers, MySchool keeps materials organized for a successful submission to educational authorities. 


### Key Features

-    A searchable record of portfolio articles -- one portfolio per student, organized by subject and date
-    Administrative access for parents or teachers for all student portfolios associated with a family or group
-    Optional account for students in a family or group -- limited to read or add abilities to prevent accidental deletion
-    Export function to instantly download, share, or print an entire portfolio or time range in PDF form
-    Activity monitoring graphic to quickly note progress on portfolio creation
-    Notifications to users to keep portfolio maintenance on track

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:
-   React
-   Chakra UI

-    React was chosen for its ease of developer onboarding and large external library availability.
-   Chakra UI was chosen for its focus on accessibility friendly components.
    -   Accessibility is always an important consideration, even more so when it comes to applications in the realm of education.


#### Front end deployed to AWS Amplify

#### [Back end](https://my-school-v1.herokuapp.com/) built using:

### Framework : Express
-    Allows for rapid implementation
-    No onboarding time concerns, all members were familiar with Express
-    Excellent documentation and other sources available
-    Stable, has been around for a while

<!-- # APIs

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy¬†... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. -->

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  PORT - set to any valid local port number for running server locally
    *  DB_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
    *  JWT_SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-*=+)') for i in range(50)])
    *  CLOUDINARY_NAME - this is your Cloudinary username
    *  CLOUDINARY_API_KEY - this is generated in your Cloudinary account
    *  CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET - this is generated in your Cloudinary account
   

<!-- # 4Ô∏è‚É£ Testing

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Installation Instructions

1. Run npm install or yarn install to install all dependencies.

## Other Scripts

build - creates a build of the application
start - starts the production server after a build is created
test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
